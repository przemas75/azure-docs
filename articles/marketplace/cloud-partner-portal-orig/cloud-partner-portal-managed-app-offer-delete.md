Delete an offer/SKU from Azure Marketplace 
==========================================

For various reasons, you may decide to remove your offer from the
Marketplace. New customers may no longer
purchase or deploy your offer, but existing customers will not be impacted.
Offer Termination is the process of terminating the service and/or
licensing agreement between you and your existing customers. Guidance
and policies related to offer removal and termination are governed by
[Microsoft Marketplace Publisher
Agreement](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=699560) (see Section
7) and the [Participation
Policies](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/marketplace/participation-policies/)
(see Section 6.2). The different supported
delete scenarios and the steps you can take are discussed.
