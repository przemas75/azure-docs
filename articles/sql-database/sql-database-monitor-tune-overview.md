# Monitoring and performance tuning

Azure SQL Database is automatically managed and flexible data service where you can easily monitor usage, add or remove resources (CPU, memory, io), find recommendations that can improve performance of your database, or let database adapt to your workload and automatically optimize performance.

## The state of an active query

To improve Azure SQL Database performance, understand that each active query request from your application is either in a running or a waiting state. When troubleshooting a performance issue in Azure SQL Database, keep the following chart in mind:

![Workload states](./media/sql-database-monitor-tune-overview/workload-states.png)

For a workload with performance issues, the performance issue my be due to CPU contention (a **running-related** condition) or individual queries are waiting on something (a **waiting-related** condition).

- **Excessive CPU utilization in your Azure SQL database**:

  You may see excessive CPU utilization causing performance issues under the following conditions:

  - Too many running queries
  - Too many compiling queries
  - One or more executing queries is using a sub-optimal query plan

  If this is the case for your workload, your goal is to either identify and tune the associated queries or upgrade the compute size or service tier to increase the capacity of your Azure SQL database to absorb the CPU requirements. For more information in scaling resources for single databases, see [Scale single database resources in Azure SQL Database](sql-database-single-database-scale.md) and for scaling resources for elastic pools, see [Scale elastic pool resources in Azure SQL Database](sql-database-elastic-pool-scale.md).

- **An individual query is waiting on something**

  Individual queries may have performance issues due to the query waiting for something. In this scenario, your goal is to remove or reduce the wait time.

### Determine if you have a running-related performance issue

You can identify running-related performance issues using several methods. The most common methods are:

- Use the [Azure portal](#monitor-databases-using-the-azure-portal) to monitor CPU percentage utilization.
- Use the following [dynamic management views](sql-database-monitoring-with-dmvs.md):

  - [sys.dm_db_resource_stats](sql-database-monitoring-with-dmvs.md#monitor-resource-use) returns CPU, I/O, and memory consumption for an Azure SQL Database database. One row exists for every 15 seconds, even if there is no activity in the database. Historical data is maintained for one hour.
  - [sys.resource_stats](sql-database-monitoring-with-dmvs.md#monitor-resource-use) returns CPU usage and storage data for an Azure SQL Database. The data is collected and aggregated within five-minute intervals.

> [!TIP]
> As a general guideline, if your CPU utilization is consistently at or above 80%, you have a running-related performance issue.

### Determine if you have a waiting-related performance issue

First, be certain that this is not a high-CPU, running-related performance issue. If it is not, the next step is to identify top waits associated with your application workload.  Common methods for showing the top wait type categories:

- The [Query Store](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/performance/monitoring-performance-by-using-the-query-store) provides wait statistics per query over time. In Query Store, wait types are combined into wait categories. The mapping of wait categories to wait types is available in [sys.query_store_wait_stats](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-query-store-wait-stats-transact-sql.md#wait-categories-mapping-table).
- [sys.dm_db_wait_stats](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-db-wait-stats-azure-sql-database) returns information about all the waits encountered by threads that executed during operation. You can use this aggregated view to diagnose performance issues with Azure SQL Database and also with specific queries and batches.
- [sys.dm_os_waiting_tasks](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-os-waiting-tasks-transact-sql) returns information about the wait queue of tasks that are waiting on some resource.

As shown in the previous chart, the most common waits are:

- Locks (blocking)
- I/O
- tempdb-related contention
- Memory grant waits

Depending on what you see, each wait category has a different troubleshooting path.

## Overview of monitoring database performance in Azure SQL Database

Monitoring the performance of a SQL database in Azure starts with monitoring the resource utilization relative to the level of database performance you choose. Monitoring helps you  determine whether your database has excess capacity or is having trouble because resources are maxed out, and then decide whether it's time to adjust the compute size and service tiers of your database in the [DTU-based purchasing model](sql-database-service-tiers-dtu.md) or [vCore-based purchasing model](sql-database-service-tiers-vcore.md). You can monitor your database in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using the following graphical tools or using SQL [dynamic management views (DMVs)](sql-database-monitoring-with-dmvs.md).

Azure SQL Database enables you to identify opportunities to improve and optimize query performance without changing resources by reviewing [performance tuning recommendations](sql-database-advisor.md). Missing indexes and poorly optimized queries are common reasons for poor database performance. You can apply these tuning recommendations to improve performance of your workload.
You can also let Azure SQL database to [automatically optimize performance of your queries](sql-database-automatic-tuning.md) by applying all identified recommendations and verifying that they improve database performance. You have the following options for monitoring and troubleshooting database performance:

- In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), click **SQL databases**, select the database, and then use the Monitoring chart to look for resources approaching their maximum. DTU consumption is shown by default. Click **Edit** to change the time range and values shown.
- Use [Query Performance Insight](sql-database-query-performance.md) to identify the queries that spend the most of resources.
- Use [SQL Database Advisor](sql-database-advisor-portal.md) to view recommendations for creating and dropping indexes, parameterizing queries, and fixing schema issues.
- Use [Azure SQL Intelligent Insights](sql-database-intelligent-insights.md) for automatic monitoring of your database performance. Once a performance issue is detected, a diagnostic log is generated with details and Root Cause Analysis (RCA) of the issue. Performance improvement recommendation is provided when possible.
- [Enable automatic tuning](sql-database-automatic-tuning-enable.md) and let Azure SQL database automatically fix identified performance issues.
- You also can use [dynamic management views (DMVs)](sql-database-monitoring-with-dmvs.md), [extended events (`XEvents`)(sql-database/sql-database-xevent-db-diff-from-svr.md), and the [Query Store](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/performance/monitoring-performance-by-using-the-query-store) to get performance parameters in real time. See [performance guidance](sql-database-performance-guidance.md) to find techniques that you can use to improve performance of Azure SQL Database if you identify some issue using these reports or views.

## Monitor databases using the Azure portal

In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), you can monitor a single database’s utilization by selecting your database and clicking the **Monitoring** chart. This brings up a **Metric** window that you can change by clicking the **Edit chart** button. Add the following metrics:

- CPU percentage
- DTU percentage
- Data IO percentage
- Database size percentage

Once you’ve added these metrics, you can continue to view them in the **Monitoring** chart with more information on the **Metric** window. All four metrics show the average utilization percentage relative to the **DTU** of your database. See the [DTU-based purchasing model](sql-database-service-tiers-dtu.md) and [vCore-based purchasing model](sql-database-service-tiers-vcore.md) articles for more information about service tiers.  

![Service tier monitoring of database performance.](./media/sql-database-single-database-monitoring/sqldb_service_tier_monitoring.png)

You can also configure alerts on the performance metrics. Click the **Add alert** button in the **Metric** window. Follow the wizard to configure your alert. You have the option to alert if the metrics exceed a certain threshold or if the metric falls below a certain threshold.

For example, if you expect the workload on your database to grow, you can choose to configure an email alert whenever your database reaches 80% on any of the performance metrics. You can use this as an early warning to figure out when you might have to switch to the next higher compute size.

The performance metrics can also help you determine if you are able to downgrade to a lower compute size. Assume you are using a Standard S2 database and all performance metrics show that the database on average does not use more than 10% at any given time. It is likely that the database will work well in Standard S1. However, be aware of workloads that spike or fluctuate before making the decision to move to a lower compute size.

## Improving database performance with more resources

Finally, if there are no actionable items that can improve performance of your database, you can change the amount of resources available in Azure SQL Database. You can assign more resources by changing the [DTU service tier](sql-database-service-tiers-dtu.md) of a single database or increase the eDTUs of an elastic pool at any time. Alternatively, if you're using the [vCore-based purchasing model](sql-database-service-tiers-vcore.md), you can change either the service tier or increase the resources allocated to your database.

1. For single databases, you can [change service tiers](sql-database-service-tiers-dtu.md) or [compute resources](sql-database-service-tiers-vcore.md) on-demand to improve database performance.
2. For multiple databases, consider using [elastic pools](sql-database-elastic-pool-guidance.md) to scale resources automatically.

## Tune and refactor application or database code

You can change application code to more optimally use the database, change indexes, force plans, or use hints to manually adapt the database to your workload. Find some guidance and tips for manual tuning and rewriting the code in the [performance guidance topic](sql-database-performance-guidance.md) article.

## Next steps
