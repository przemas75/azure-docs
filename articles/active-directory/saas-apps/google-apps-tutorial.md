# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with G Suite

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate G Suite with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating G Suite with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to G Suite.
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to G Suite (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [what is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with G Suite, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A G Suite single sign-on enabled subscription
- A Google Apps subscription or Google Cloud Platform subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Frequently Asked Questions

1.	**Q: Does this integration support Google Cloud Platform SSO integration with Azure AD?**
	
	A: Yes. Google Cloud Platform and Google Apps share the same authentication platform. So to do the GCP integration you need to configure the SSO with Google Apps.


1. **Q: Are Chromebooks and other Chrome devices compatible with Azure AD single sign-on?**
   
    A: Yes, users are able to sign into their Chromebook devices using their Azure AD credentials. See this [G Suite support article](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/6060880) for information on why users may get prompted for credentials twice.

1. **Q: If I enable single sign-on, will users be able to use their Azure AD credentials to sign into any Google product, such as Google Classroom, GMail, Google Drive, YouTube, and so on?**
   
    A: Yes, depending on [which G Suite](https://support.google.com/a/answer/182442?hl=en&ref_topic=1227583) you choose to enable or disable for your organization.

1. **Q: Can I enable single sign-on for only a subset of my G Suite users?**
   
    A: No, turning on single sign-on immediately requires all your G Suite users to authenticate with their Azure AD credentials. Because G Suite doesn't support having multiple identity providers, the identity provider for your G Suite environment can either be Azure AD or Google -- but not both at the same time.

1. **Q: If a user is signed in through Windows, are they automatically authenticate to G Suite without getting prompted for a password?**
   
    A: There are two options for enabling this scenario. First, users could sign into Windows 10 devices via [Azure Active Directory Join](../device-management-introduction.md). Alternatively, users could sign into Windows devices that are domain-joined to an on-premises Active Directory that has been enabled for single sign-on to Azure AD via an [Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)](../hybrid/plan-connect-user-signin.md) deployment. Both options require you to perform the steps in the following tutorial to enable single sign-on between Azure AD and G Suite.

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding G Suite from the gallery
1. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding G Suite from the gallery

To configure the integration of G Suite into Azure AD, you need to add G Suite from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add G Suite from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with G Suite based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in G Suite is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in G Suite needs to be established.

In G Suite, assign the value of the **user name** in Azure AD as the value of the **Username** to establish the link relationship.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with G Suite, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
1. **[Create a G Suite test user](#create-a-g-suite-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in G Suite that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your G Suite application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with G Suite, perform the following steps:**

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **G Suite** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.
