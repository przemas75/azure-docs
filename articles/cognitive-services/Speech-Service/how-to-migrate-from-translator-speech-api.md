# Migrate from the Translator Speech API to the Speech Service

Use this article to migrate your applications from the Microsoft Translator Speech API to the [Speech Service](index.yml). This guide outlines the differences between the Translator Speech API and Speech Service, and suggests strategies for migrating your applications.

> [!NOTE]
> Your Translator Speech API subscription key won't be accepted by the Speech Service. You will need to start a new Speech Service subscription.

## Migration strategies

If you or your organization have applications in development or production that use the Translator Speech API, you should update them to use the Speech Service. See the [Speech Service](index.yml) documentation for available SDKs, code samples, and tutorials. Below are some things to consider when migrating:

* The Speech Service does not currently offer a global endpoint. You will need to determine if your application will function efficiently using a single regional endpoint for all of it's traffic. If it won't, you will need to use geolocation to determine the most efficient endpoint.

* If your application uses long-lived connections and can't use the available SDKs, you can use a websocket connection and manage the 10-minute timeout limit by reconnecting at the appropriate times.

* If your application uses the Translator Text API and Translator Speech API to enable custom translation models, you will be able to add â€˜Categoryâ€™ IDs directly using the Speech Service.

* The Speech Service can complete translations into multiple languages in a single request, unlike the Translator Speech API.
