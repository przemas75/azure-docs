# Quickstart: Publish a QnA Maker knowledge base in Node.js

This quickstart walks you through programmatically publishing your knowledge base (KB). Publishing pushes the latest version of the knowledge base to a dedicated Azure Search index and creates an endpoint that can be called in your application or chat bot.

This quickstart calls QnA Maker APIs:
* [Publish](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5a93fcf85b4ccd136866eb37/operations/5ac266295b4ccd1554da75fe) - this API doesn't require any information in the body of the request.

## Prerequisites

* [Node.js 6+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* You must have a [QnA Maker service](../How-To/set-up-qnamaker-service-azure.md). To retrieve your key, select **Keys** under **Resource Management** in your dashboard. 
* QnA Maker knowledge base (KB) ID found in the URL in the kbid query string parameter as shown below.

    ![QnA Maker knowledge base ID](../media/qnamaker-quickstart-kb/qna-maker-id.png)

If you don't have a knowledge base yet, you can create a sample one to use for this quickstart: [Create a new knowledge base](create-new-kb-nodejs.md).

[!INCLUDE [Code is available in Azure-Samples Github repo](../../../../includes/cognitive-services-qnamaker-nodejs-repo-note.md)]

## Create a knowledge base Node.js file

Create a file named `publish-knowledge-base.js`.

## Add required dependencies

At the top of `publish-knowledge-base.js`, add the following lines to add necessary dependencies to the project:

[!code-nodejs[Add the dependencies](~/samples-qnamaker-nodejs/documentation-samples/quickstarts/publish-knowledge-base/publish-knowledge-base.js?range=1-4 "Add the dependencies")]

## Add required constants

After the preceding required dependencies, add the required constants to access QnA Maker. Replace the value of the `subscriptionKey`variable with your own QnA Maker key. 

[!code-nodejs[Add required constants](~/samples-qnamaker-nodejs/documentation-samples/quickstarts/publish-knowledge-base/publish-knowledge-base.js?range=10-17 "Add required constants")]

## Add knowledge base ID

After the previous constants, add the knowledge base ID and add it to the path:

[!code-nodejs[Add knowledge base ID](~/samples-qnamaker-nodejs/documentation-samples/quickstarts/publish-knowledge-base/publish-knowledge-base.js?range=19-23 "Add knowledge base ID")]

## Add supporting functions

Next, add the following supporting functions.

1. Add the following function to print out JSON in a readable format:

   [!code-nodejs[Add supporting functions, step 1](~/samples-qnamaker-nodejs/documentation-samples/quickstarts/publish-knowledge-base/publish-knowledge-base.js?range=25-28 "Add supporting functions, step 1")]

2. Add the following functions to manage the HTTP response to get the creation operation status:

   [!code-nodejs[Add supporting functions, step 2](~/samples-qnamaker-nodejs/documentation-samples/quickstarts/publish-knowledge-base/publish-knowledge-base.js?range=30-52 "Add supporting functions, step 2")]

## Add the publish_kb function and main function

The following code makes an HTTPS request to the QnA Maker API to publish a KB and receives the response:

[!code-nodejs[Add POST request to publish KB](~/samples-qnamaker-nodejs/documentation-samples/quickstarts/publish-knowledge-base/publish-knowledge-base.js?range=54-71 "Add POST request to publish KB")]

[!code-nodejs[Add the publish_kb function](~/samples-qnamaker-nodejs/documentation-samples/quickstarts/publish-knowledge-base/publish-knowledge-base.js?range=73-91 "Add the publish_kb function and main function")]

## Add the main function

Add the following function to manage the request and response:

[!code-nodejs[Add the main function](~/samples-qnamaker-nodejs/documentation-samples/quickstarts/publish-knowledge-base/publish-knowledge-base.js?range=94-97 "Add the main function")]

## Run the program

Build and run the program. It will automatically send the request to the QnA Maker API to publish the KB, then the response is printed to the console window.

Once your knowledge base is published, you can query it from the endpoint with a client application or chat bot. 

```bash
node publish-knowledge-base.js
```
