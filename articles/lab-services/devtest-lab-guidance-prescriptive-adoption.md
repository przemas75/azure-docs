# Set up Azure DevTest Labs infrastructure in your enterprise
Enterprises are adopting the cloud rapidly due to its benefits from an agility, flexibility and economics perspective. A usual first step into the cloud is migrating development and test workloads. There is a common set of concerns when migrating these workloads such as the following ones: 

- Securing development/test resources
- Clear separation between dev/test and production
- Division of resources between IT, application, and project Teams
- Managing cost
- Allowing self-service of setting up dev/test infrastructure without compromising security

## Intended audience
This document is intended for IT planners, architects, and managers who are responsible for establishing and reviewing overall deployments and overseeing operations practices. As a result, this document emphasizes the overall process and recommended design principles to promote a secure and stable development environment, which ultimately drives adoption of Azure DevTest Labs within an
organization.
