# Tutorial: Create Azure Resource Manager templates with dependent resources

Learn how to create an Azure Resource Manager template to deploy multiple resources.  After you create the template, you deploy the template using the Cloud shell from the Azure portal.

In this tutorial, you create a storage account, a virtual machine, a virtual network, and some other dependent resources. Some of the resources cannot be deployed until another resource exists. For example, you can't create the virtual machine until its storage account and network interface exist. You define this relationship by making one resource as dependent on the other resources. Resource Manager evaluates the dependencies between resources, and deploys them in their dependent order. When resources aren't dependent on each other, Resource Manager deploys them in parallel. For more information, see [Define the order for deploying resources in Azure Resource Manager Templates](./resource-group-define-dependencies.md).

This tutorial covers the following tasks:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Prepare the Key Vault
> * Open a quickstart template
> * Explore the template
> * Edit the parameters file
> * Deploy the template

If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To complete this article, you need:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the Resource Manager Tools extension.  See [Install the extension
](./resource-manager-quickstart-create-templates-use-visual-studio-code.md#prerequisites)

## Prepare Key Vault

To prevent the password spray attacks, it is recommended to use an autogenerated password for the virtual machine administrator account, and use Key Vault to store the password. The following procedure creates a Key Vault and a secret to store the password. It also configures the permissions needed for the template deployment to access the secret stored in the Key Vault. Additional access policies are needed if the Key Vault is under a different Azure subscription. For details, see [Use Azure Key Vault to pass secure parameter value during deployment](./resource-manager-keyvault-parameter.md).

1. Sign in to the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com).
2. Switch to your favorite environment, either **PowerShell** or **Bash** from the upper left corner.
3. Run the following Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI command.  

    ```azurecli-interactive
    keyVaultName='<your-unique-vault-name>'
    resourceGroupName='<your-resource-group-name>'
    location='Central US'
    userPrincipalName='<your-email-address-associated-with-your-subscription>'
    
    # Create a resource group
    az group create --name $resourceGroupName --location $location
    
    # Create a Key Vault
    keyVault=$(az keyvault create \
      --name $keyVaultName \
      --resource-group $resourceGroupName \
      --location $location \
      --enabled-for-template-deployment true)
    keyVaultId=$(echo $keyVault | jq -r '.id')
    az keyvault set-policy --upn $userPrincipalName --name $keyVaultName --secret-permissions set delete get list

    # Create a secret
    password=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
    az keyvault secret set --vault-name $keyVaultName --name 'vmAdminPassword' --value $password
    
    # Print the useful property values
    echo "You need the following values for the virtual machine deployment:"
    echo "Resource group name is: $resourceGroupName."
    echo "The admin password is: $password."
    echo "The Key Vault resource ID is: $keyVaultId."
    ```

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    $keyVaultName = "<your-unique-vault-name>"
    $resourceGroupName="<your-resource-group-name>"
    $location='Central US'
    $userPrincipalName="<your-email-address-associated-with-your-subscription>"
    
    # Create a resource group
    New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name $resourceGroupName -Location $location
        
    # Create a Key Vault
    $keyVault = New-AzureRmKeyVault `
      -VaultName $keyVaultName `
      -resourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
      -Location $location `
      -EnabledForTemplateDeployment
    Set-AzureRmKeyVaultAccessPolicy -VaultName $keyVaultName -UserPrincipalName $userPrincipalName -PermissionsToSecrets set,delete,get,list
      
    # Create a secret
    $password = openssl rand -base64 32
    
    $secretValue = ConvertTo-SecureString $password -AsPlainText -Force
    Set-AzureKeyVaultSecret -VaultName $keyVaultName -Name "vmAdminPassword" -SecretValue $secretValue
    
    # Print the useful property values
    echo "You need the following values for the virtual machine deployment:"
    echo "Resource group name is: $resourceGroupName."
    echo "The admin password is: $password."
    echo "The Key Vault resource ID is: " $keyVault.ResourceID
    ```
4. Write down the output values. You need them later in the tutorial

> [!NOTE]
> Each Azure service has specific password requirements. For example, the Azure virtual machine's requirements can be found at What are the password requirements when creating a VM?

## Open a Quickstart template

Azure QuickStart Templates is a repository for Resource Manager templates. Instead of creating a template from scratch, you can find a sample template and customize it. The template used in this tutorial is called [Deploy a simple Windows VM](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/101-vm-simple-windows/).

1. From Visual Studio Code, select **File**>**Open File**.
2. In **File name**, paste the following URL:

    ```url
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/101-vm-simple-windows/azuredeploy.json
    ```
3. Select **Open** to open the file.
4. Select **File**>**Save As** to save a copy of the file to your local computer with the name **azuredeploy.json**.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 to open **https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/101-vm-simple-windows/azuredeploy.parameters.json**, and then save the file as **azuredeploy.parameters.json**.

## Explore the template

When you explore the template in this section, try to answer these questions:

- How many Azure resources defined in this template?
- One of the resources is an Azure storage account.  Does the definition look like the one used in the last tutorial?
- Can you find the template references for the resources defined in this template?
- Can you find the dependencies of the resources?

1. From Visual Studio Code, collapse the elements until you only see the first-level elements and the second-level elements inside **resources**:

    ![Visual Studio Code Azure Resource Manager templates](./media/resource-manager-tutorial-create-templates-with-dependent-resources/resource-manager-template-visual-studio-code.png)

    There are five resources defined by the template.
2. Expand the first resource. It is a storage account. The definition shall be identical to the one used at the beginning of the last tutorial.

    ![Visual Studio Code Azure Resource Manager templates storage account definition](./media/resource-manager-tutorial-create-templates-with-dependent-resources/resource-manager-template-storage-account-definition.png)

3. Expand the second resource. The resource type is **Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses**. To find the template reference, browse to [template reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/templates/), enter **public ip address** or **public ip addresses** in the **Filter by title** field. Compare the resource definition to the template reference.

    ![Visual Studio Code Azure Resource Manager templates public IP address definition](./media/resource-manager-tutorial-create-templates-with-dependent-resources/resource-manager-template-public-ip-address-definition.png)
4. Repeat the last step to find the template references for the other resources defined in this template.  Compare the resource definitions to the references.
5. Expand the fourth resource:

    ![Visual Studio Code Azure Resource Manager templates dependson](./media/resource-manager-tutorial-create-templates-with-dependent-resources/resource-manager-template-visual-studio-code-dependson.png)

    The dependsOn element enables you to define one resource as a dependent on one or more resources. In this example, this resource is a networkInterface.  It depends on two other resources:

    * publicIPAddress
    * virtualNetwork

6. Expand the fifth resource. This resource is a virtual machine. It depends on two other resources:

    * storageAccount
    * networkInterface

The following diagram illustrates the resources and the dependency information for this template:

![Visual Studio Code Azure Resource Manager templates dependency diagram](./media/resource-manager-tutorial-create-templates-with-dependent-resources/resource-manager-template-visual-studio-code-dependency-diagram.png)

By specifying the dependencies, Resource Manager efficiently deploys the solution. It deploys the storage account, public IP address, and virtual network in parallel because they have no dependencies. After the public IP address and virtual network are deployed, the network interface is created. When all other resources are deployed, Resource Manager deploys the virtual machine.

## Edit the parameters file

You don't need to make any changes to the template file. But you need to modify the parameters file to retrieve the administrator password from the Key Vault.

1. Open **azuredeploy.parameters.json** in Visual Studio Code if it is not opened.
2. Update the **adminPassword** parameter to:

    ```json
    "adminPassword": {
        "reference": {
            "keyVault": {
            "id": "/subscriptions/<SubscriptionID>/resourceGroups/mykeyvaultdeploymentrg/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/<KeyVaultName>"
            },
            "secretName": "vmAdminPassword"
        }
    },
    ```
    Replace the **id** with the resource ID of your Key Vault created in the last procedure. It is one of the outputs. 

    ![integrate key vault and Resource Manager template virtual machine deployment parameters file](./media/resource-manager-tutorial-use-key-vault/resource-manager-tutorial-create-vm-parameters-file.png)
3. Give the values to:

    - **adminUsername**: name the virtual machine administrator account.
    - **dnsLabelPrefix**: name the dnsLablePrefix.
4. Save the changes.

## Deploy the template

There are many methods for deploying templates.  In this tutorial, you use Cloud Shell from the Azure portal.

1. Sign in to the [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com). You can also sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and then select **Cloud Shell** from the upper right corner as shown in the following image:

    ![Azure portal Cloud shell](./media/resource-manager-tutorial-create-templates-with-dependent-resources/azure-portal-cloud-shell.png)
2. Select **PowerShell** from the upper left corner of the Cloud shell, and then select **Confirm**.  You use PowerShell in this tutorial.
3. Select **Upload file** from the Cloud shell:

    ![Azure portal Cloud shell upload file](./media/resource-manager-tutorial-create-templates-with-dependent-resources/azure-portal-cloud-shell-upload-file.png)
4. Select the files you saved earlier in the tutorial. The default name is **azuredeploy.json** and **azuredeploy.paraemters.json**.  If you have files with the same file names, the old files will be overwritten without any notification.
5. From the Cloud shell, run the following command to verify the file is uploaded successfully. 

    ```bash
    ls
    ```

    ![Azure portal Cloud shell list file](./media/resource-manager-tutorial-create-templates-with-dependent-resources/azure-portal-cloud-shell-list-file.png)

    The file name shown on the screenshot is azuredeploy.json.

6. From the Cloud shell run the following command to verify the content of the JSON file:

    ```bash
    cat azuredeploy.json
    cat azuredeploy.parameters.json
    ```
7. From the Cloud shell, run the following PowerShell commands. The sample script uses the same resource group created for the Key Vault. Using the same resource group makes it easier to clean up the resources.

    ```powershell
    $resourceGroupName = "<Enter the resource group name>"
    $deploymentName = "<Enter a deployment name>"

    New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -Name $deploymentName `
        -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
	    -TemplateFile azuredeploy.json `
        -TemplateparameterFile azuredeploy.parameters.json
    ```
8. Run the following PowerShell command to list the newly created virtual machine:

    ```powershell
    Get-AzureRmVM -Name SimpleWinVM -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName
    ```

    The virtual machine name is hard-coded as **SimpleWinVM** inside the template.

9. Sign in to the virtual machine to test the administrator's credentials. 

## Clean up resources

When the Azure resources are no longer needed, clean up the resources you deployed by deleting the resource group.

1. From the Azure portal, select **Resource group** from the left menu.
2. Enter the resource group name in the **Filter by name** field.
3. Select the resource group name.  You shall see a total of six resources in the resource group.
4. Select **Delete resource group** from the top menu.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you develop and deploy a template to create a virtual machine, a virtual network, and the dependent resources. To learn how to deploy Azure resources based on conditions, see:
