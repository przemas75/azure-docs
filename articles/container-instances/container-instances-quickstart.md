# Quickstart: Run an application in Azure Container Instances

Use Azure Container Instances to run Docker containers in Azure with simplicity and speed. You don't need to deploy virtual machines or use a full container orchestration platform like Kubernetes. In this quickstart, you use the Azure portal to create a container in Azure and make its application available with a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). A few seconds after you execute a single deployment command, you can browse to the running application:

![App deployed to Azure Container Instances viewed in browser][aci-app-browser]

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account][azure-account] before you begin.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

You can use the Azure Cloud Shell or a local installation of the Azure CLI to complete this quickstart. If you'd like to use it locally, you need version 2.0.27 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][azure-cli-install].

## Create a resource group

Azure container instances, like all Azure resources, must be deployed into a resource group. Resource groups allow you to organize and manage related Azure resources.

First, create a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* location with the following [az group create][az-group-create] command:

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
```

## Create a container

Now that you have a resource group, you can run a container in Azure. To create a container instance with the Azure CLI, provide a resource group name, container instance name, and Docker container image to the [az container create][az-container-create] command. You can expose your containers to the internet by specifying one or more ports to open, a DNS name label, or both. In this quickstart, you deploy a container with a DNS name label that hosts a small web app written in Node.js.

Execute the following command to start a container instance. The `--dns-name-label` value must be unique within the Azure region you create the instance. If you receive a "DNS name label not available" error message, try a different DNS name label.

```azurecli-interactive
az container create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name mycontainer --image microsoft/aci-helloworld --dns-name-label aci-demo --ports 80
```

Within a few seconds, you should get a response from the Azure CLI indicating that the deployment has completed. Check its status with the [az container show][az-container-show] command:

```azurecli-interactive
az container show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name mycontainer --query "{FQDN:ipAddress.fqdn,ProvisioningState:provisioningState}" --out table
```

When you run the command, the container's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) and its provisioning state are displayed.

```console
$ az container show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name mycontainer --query "{FQDN:ipAddress.fqdn,ProvisioningState:provisioningState}" --out table
FQDN                               ProvisioningState
---------------------------------  -------------------
aci-demo.eastus.azurecontainer.io  Succeeded
```

If the container's `ProvisioningState` is **Succeeded**, navigate to its FQDN in your browser. If you see a web page similar to the following, congratulations! You've successfully deployed an application running in a Docker container to Azure.

If at first the application isn't displayed, you might need to wait a few seconds while DNS propagates, then try refreshing your browser.

## Pull the container logs

When you need to troubleshoot a container or the application it runs (or just see its output), start by viewing the container instance's logs.

Pull the container instance logs with the [az container logs][az-container-logs] command:

```azurecli-interactive
az container logs --resource-group myResourceGroup --name mycontainer
```

The output displays the logs for the container, and should show the HTTP GET requests generated when you viewed the application in your browser.

```console
$ az container logs --resource-group myResourceGroup --name mycontainer
listening on port 80
::ffff:10.240.255.105 - - [01/Oct/2018:18:25:51 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.0" 200 1663 "-" "-"
::ffff:10.240.255.106 - - [01/Oct/2018:18:31:04 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 1663 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/69.0.3497.100 Safari/537.36"
::ffff:10.240.255.106 - - [01/Oct/2018:18:31:04 +0000] "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1" 404 150 "http://aci-demo-marsma01.eastus.azurecontainer.io/" "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/69.0.3497.100 Safari/537.36"
```

## Attach output streams

In addition to viewing the logs, you can attach your local standard out and standard error streams to that of the container.

First, execute the [az container attach][az-container-attach] command to attach your local console the container's output streams:

```azurecli-interactive
az container attach --resource-group myResourceGroup -n mycontainer
```

Once attached, refresh your browser a few times to generate some additional output. When you're done, detach your console with `Control+C`. You should see output similar to the following:

```console
$ az container attach --resource-group myResourceGroup -n mycontainer
Container 'mycontainer' is in state 'Running'...

Start streaming logs:

```

## Clean up resources

When you're done with the container, remove it using the [az container delete][az-container-delete] command:

```azurecli-interactive
az container delete --resource-group myResourceGroup --name mycontainer
```

To verify that the container has been deleted, execute the [az container list](/cli/azure/container#az-container-list) command:

```azurecli-interactive
az container list --resource-group myResourceGroup --output table
```

The **mycontainer** container should not appear in the command's output. If you have no other containers in the resource group, no output is displayed.

If you're done with the *myResourceGroup* resource group and all the resources it contains, delete it with the [az group delete][az-group-delete] command:

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you created an Azure container instance by using an image in the public Docker Hub registry. If you'd like to build a container image and deploy it from a private Azure container registry, continue to the Azure Container Instances tutorial.
